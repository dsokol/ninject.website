			<h2>Bend software to your will</h2>
			Stop writing monolithic applications that make you feel like you have to move mountains to make the simplest of changes.
			Ninject helps you use the technique of <em>dependency injection</em> to break your applications into <em>loosely-coupled,
			highly-cohesive</em> components, and then glue them back together in a flexible manner.
		</div>
		<div id="card-2" class="card">
			<h2>Laugh in the face of change</h2>
			Change is inevitable, so be prepared. Ninject allows you to <em>embrace change</em> in your software's design, so it will
			be easier to adjust it to <em>match changing business needs</em> and expectations. Then, the next time someone asks for
			a "small" change to your application, you can <em>laugh in triumph</em> rather than quivering in pain.
		</div>
		<div id="card-3" class="card">
			<h2>Use your sharpest tools</h2>
			Once you break your application into components, you have to glue them back together. Rather than depending on a bunch of
			XML to describe how the pieces fit together, Ninject uses a powerful <em>fluent interface</em>. This lets you get the
			most out of the sharpest tools in your arsenal: your compiler and your IDE.
		</div>
		<div id="card-4" class="card">
			<h2>Write smarter software everywhere</h2>
			Dependency injection isn't just for big enterprise applications; with the right framework, you can apply the practice to
			improve software projects of <em>all sizes and types</em>. Ninject was designed to be ultra-lightweight and universal.
			It also <em>runs practically anywhere</em>, including on Mono, the .NET Compact Framework, and Silverlight.
		</div>
		<div id="card-5" class="card">
			<h2>Be fast, be agile, be precise</h2>
			Ninject makes dependency injection <em>so easy</em> that it becomes hard not to follow good practices. Once you start
			writing your applications with dependency injection in mind, your code will be easier to understand, easier to change,
			and less error-prone. Simply put, Ninject makes your application <em>more ninja-like!</em>

				<h3>Why is Ninject useful?</h3>
				The vast majority of effort that is invested in software happens <em>after the initial release</em>. Because
				Ninject makes your software much <em>easier to change</em>, a small up-front time investment will pay huge
				dividends as time goes on.

				<h3>What makes Ninject different?</h3>
				An obsessive focus on <em>simplicity</em> and <em>ease of use</em>. We've seen the value of dependency
				injection, but were frustrated by the complexity of existing solutions. The goal of Ninject is make dependency
				injection accessible to <em>all developers</em> and <em>all projects</em>.

			<div class="last section">
				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
				Ninject is and will always be <em>free</em> for both personal and commercial projects. It's also <em>open source</em>,
				so you can fork <a href="http://github.com/enkari/ninject" target="_blank">the code</a> and make any changes
				you like. (We appreciate it if you share anything useful you come up with us, though!)
